		The Force is a mystical, {{ adjective }} power. As Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi once said, "The Force is an energy field, created by all living {{ plural noun }}, that surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the {{ noun }} together." Using the power of the Force, a Jedi can do many {{ adjective }} things, like using the Force to exercise {{ part of the body }} control over {{ adjective }}-minded {{ plural noun }}. A Jedi can also use the Force to move objects with his or her {{ part of the body }}. It doesn't matter how {{ adjective }} these objects are; it only matters how {{ adverb }} the Jedi believes in the Force. Most importantly, the Force teaches a Jedi to rely on his or her feelings. As Obi-Wan Kenobi told his student, Luke {{ noun }}-walker: "Your {{ part of the body (plural) }} can deceive you. Don't trust them." Instead, a Jedi should {{ adverb }} trust in the Force.
